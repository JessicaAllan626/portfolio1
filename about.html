<section class="About">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there and welcome to my portfolio. As you could see already, my name is Jessica and I am currently a student at ElevenFifty Academy studying web development. I finished a 4 year bachelors degree in Animal Science at Purdue University, but was not satisfied in the career options I was seeing at the end of those 4 long years. After a huge decision to change careers, I found myself at ElevenFifty and have not looked back since. I love the puzzles and challenges that come along with the web development world and love to learn new things.</p>
